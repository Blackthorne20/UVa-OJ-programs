These are my solutions to UVa Online Judge problems. Visit https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/id/682757 to see my profile.

Note that some of these problems are incomplete. There are also three files that I use as generic templates for setting up different types of problems quickly: BigInteger.cpp, Sieve.cpp, and UVa.cpp. I borrowed the BigInteger class from the user "panks".
